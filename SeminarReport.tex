Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. This field first became an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and Fig. \ref{a}

\chapter{CONCLUSION}


Controller, Gf (z) is a filter to obtain a stable overall closed-loop system, and Q(z) is a lowpass filter to enhance the robustness of the overall system at the cost of imperfect elimination of high-frequency errors.
The feedback controller Gc(z) is chosen so that the transfer function.
